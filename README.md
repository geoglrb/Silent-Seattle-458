‘Silent Seattle’!

A 'crowd-sourced' collection of places of interest in Seattle. Please offer us places that you find interesting but are likely yet unknown to most of us.

* Many of these are going to be represented as points, but some of them may be polygons or lines. All of them should have attribute data filled out.
* Each student in 458 contributes at least one entity.
* You must use GitHub/git workflows and geojso.io.
* No manual uploading or downloading or copying or pasting!

Third-to-last step should be to issue @geoglrb a pull request to merge in your thoughtful additions to the GeoJSON file.

Second-to-last step is to have @geoglrb merge the results and you verify the map.

Last step is to collaboratively and constructively ensure that each and every member of the group has an adequate understanding of what exactly you all did today, such that when @geoglrb choses one of the group members to explain what was done and why, it makes sense to him.
